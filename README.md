# A-and-Dijkstra-algorithm
Python implementation of A* and Dijkstra algorithm
Implemented Dijkstra and A* algorithm to find a path between start and end point on a given map for a Point Robot (radius = 0; clearance = 0) as well as a Rigid Robot (radius and clearance are variable)
Considered the workspace as a 8 connected space, that means now you can move the robot in up, down, left, right & diagonally between up-left, up-right, down-left and down-right directions, with linear movement cost as 1 unit and diagonal movement cost as âˆš2.
